This is the old Snort HTTP preprocessor ported to Snort++ and made into an
inspector. A new HTTP inspector currently known as NHttpInspect is under
development in a neighboring directory. Eventually NHttpInspect will be
renamed HttpInspect and this module will be retired. Meanwhile the
abbreviations HI and NHI are sometimes used when it is important to
distinguish the two modules.

HI and NHI are not intended to be used together. Only configure one of them
at a time.

The starting point is http_inspect.cc which defines the HttpInspect
subclass of Inspector. Within that look to member eval() which accepts a
packet from the framework and processes it.

HI evolved from a stateless packet processor and to a very substantial
extent it still is one despite having a fully-developed stream splitter.
That means it often does not know for sure what part of the HTTP message it
is looking at and it makes great effort to try and overcome that. Always
keep this in mind when trying to understand what HI is doing.

The other useful thing to remember is HI processes request ("client") and
response ("server") messages through largely separate code paths and far
more differently than you would expect from reading the RFC.
