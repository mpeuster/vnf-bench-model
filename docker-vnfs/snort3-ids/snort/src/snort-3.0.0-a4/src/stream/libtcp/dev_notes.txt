This directory contains the implementation of common TCP session tracking functions.

This TCP library module provides the following functions:

* TCP Segment Descriptor - this class provides access to the various fields of the TCP
  header and payload

* TCP Stream Tracker - this class encapsulates all the state information required for
  tracking one side of the TCP connection.  For each flow that is tracked there will be
  two instances of this tracker, one for each direction.

* TCP State Handler - abstract class interface that defines a method for handling each
  possible TCP event.  For each TCP state a subclass of this class is created with a
  state specific implementation for each event handling method.

* TCP State Machine - this class is the engine that dispatches processing to the correct
  event handling method of the handler for the current TCP state of the flow.
