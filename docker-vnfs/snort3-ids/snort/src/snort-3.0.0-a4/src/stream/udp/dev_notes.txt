This directory contains the implementation of UDP session tracking and
processing functions.  When the network protocol for a flow is determined
to be UDP the base Stream preprocessor will delegate handling of the
packets on that flow to this module.

The StreamUdp class is implemented as a subclass of Inspector and provides
functions for loading stream UDP configuration and packet evaluation.  The
packet eval method is not used as the base Stream Inspector delegates
packets directly to the UDP session packet processing method.
