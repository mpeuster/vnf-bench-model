This directory contains the implementation of ICMP session tracking and
processing functions.  When the network protocol for a flow is determined
to be ICMP the base Stream preprocessor will delegate handling of the
packets on that flow to this module.

The StreamIcmp class is implemented as a subclass of Inspector and provides
functions for loading stream ICMP configuration and packet evaluation.  The
packet eval method is not used as the base Stream Inspector delegates
packets directly to the ICMP session packet processing method.

Currently only the ICMP Unreachable message is handled by the ICMP session
module.
