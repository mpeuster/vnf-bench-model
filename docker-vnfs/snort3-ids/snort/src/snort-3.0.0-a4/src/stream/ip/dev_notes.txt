This directory contains the implementation of IP session tracking and
processing functions.  When the network protocol for a flow is determined
to be IP the base Stream preprocessor will delegate handling of the packets
on that flow to this module.

The StreamIp class is implemented as a subclass of Inspector and provides
functions for loading stream IP configuration and packet evaluation.  The
packet eval method is not used as the base Stream Inspector delegates
packets directly to the IP session packet processing method.
