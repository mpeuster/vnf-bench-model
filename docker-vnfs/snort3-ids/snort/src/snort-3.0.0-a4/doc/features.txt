The features listed below must be explicitly enabled so they are built
into the Snort binary.  For a full list of build features, run ./configure
--help.

*  *--enable-shell*: enable building local and remote command line shell
   support.

These features are built only if the required libraries and headers are
present.  There is no need to explicitly enable.

* *lzma*: for decompression of SWF and PDF files.

* *openssl*: for SHA and MD5 file signatures and the protected_content rule
  option.

* *intel-soft-cpm": an optional pattern matcher based on a library from
  Intel.

* hyperscan for the regex rule option and hyperscan search engine.

If you need to use headers and/or libraries in non-standard locations, you
can use these options:

* *--with-pkg-includes*: specify the directory containing the package
  headers.

* *--with-pkg-libraries*: specify the directory containing the package
  libraries.

These can be use for pcap, luajit, pcre, dnet, daq, lzma, openssl,
intel-soft-cpm, and hyperscan packages.  For more information on these
libraries see the Getting Started section of the manual.
